# ROSMonitoringPlugAndPlay
Plug and Play version of the standard ROSMonitoring (https://github.com/autonomy-and-verification-uol/ROSMonitoring).
Rather than the standard ROSMonitoring version, this implementation allows us to Plug and Play monitor at runtime. Thanks to this new feature, we can start and stop monitoring our ROS nodes depending on the specific context. The main advantage of this approach is in reducing the overhead of the monitor when we do not need it.
In general we do not need to have always a monitor checking the ROS topics, but when the robot is exploited in safety critical applications, it could be necessary to check the robot behaviour. Thanks to the Plug and Play feature, we can easily add a monitor to any ROS system, for checking only when it is required to (reducing as mush as possible the monitor overhead).
